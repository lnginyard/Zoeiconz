# Zoeiconz
 
## Description
An icon set hoisting two versions of the 
same icon. One version is the simple, yet powerful version with max whitespace in mind and the other version is a more intricate, modern design that's handcrafted 
and true to my asthetic. 
## Getting Started
You may clone this repository and use the icons to either edit and make your own icons. Or you can just save the icons and use them whereever you like.
### Dependencies
